## üîç Verify Deployment

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T..."
}
```

### 2. Root Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "message": "Luma Backend API",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "health": "/api/v1/health",
    "auth": "/api/v1/auth",
    "dashboard": "/api/v1/dashboard"
  }
}
```

### 3. Check Logs
```bash
railway logs --tail 100
```

Look for:
```
‚úÖ Database connection successful
üöÄ Luma Backend Server Started
‚è∞ Starting Phase 3 cron jobs...
üßπ Starting cache cleanup service...
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Process

Railway will execute:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 2. Build TypeScript
npm run build

# 3. Start server
npm start
```

**Build Output:**
- `dist/` folder containing compiled JavaScript
- Type definitions (`.d.ts` files)
- Source maps for debugging

**Build Time:** ~2-3 minutes
**Deploy Time:** ~30 seconds

---

## üìä Resource Requirements

### Recommended Railway Plan

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Memory** | 512MB | 1GB |
| **CPU** | Shared | Dedicated |
| **Storage** | 1GB | 5GB |
| **Plan** | Trial ($5/month) | Hobby ($5/month) |

**Why these specs:**
- Cron jobs require persistent memory
- OpenAI API calls need stable connection
- Database connections need adequate CPU

---

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Update Frontend CORS

After deployment, update your frontend's API URL:

**Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Update `VITE_API_URL` to `https://your-app.railway.app`
4. Redeploy frontend

**Or via CLI:**
```bash
vercel env rm VITE_API_URL production
vercel env add VITE_API_URL production
# Enter: https://your-app.railway.app
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Test Full Integration

```bash
# 1. Test signup
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!","full_name":"Test User"}'

# 2. Test login
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}'

# 3. Test with frontend
# Open https://your-frontend.vercel.app
# Try signup ‚Üí login ‚Üí chat ‚Üí goals ‚Üí journal
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Build Fails

**Error:** `tsc: command not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure devDependencies are installed during build
# Railway does this automatically, but verify:
railway run npm install
railway run npm run build
```

---

### Issue 2: Server Won't Start

**Error:** `Missing environment variable: SUPABASE_URL`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check all variables are set
railway variables

# Add missing variables
railway variables set SUPABASE_URL=your_url
```

---

### Issue 3: Database Connection Failed

**Error:** `Database connection failed`

**Solution:**
1. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
2. Check Supabase project is not paused
3. Verify service role key (not anon key) is used
4. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`

---

### Issue 4: CORS Errors from Frontend

**Error:** `CORS policy blocked`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update FRONTEND_URL to match your Vercel domain
railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://your-exact-vercel-url.vercel.app

# Restart service
railway restart
```

---

### Issue 5: Cron Jobs Not Running

**Symptoms:** No insights generated, nudges not appearing

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs for cron job messages
railway logs --tail 200 | grep CRON

# Should see:
# ‚è∞ Starting Phase 3 cron jobs...
# [CRON] Initializing cron jobs...
# [CRON] All cron jobs started successfully

# If not, check NODE_ENV is set:
railway variables | grep NODE_ENV
```

## üìà Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

1. **Metrics**: View CPU, Memory, Network usage
2. **Logs**: Real-time log streaming
3. **Deployments**: Track deployment history
4. **Usage**: Monitor monthly costs

### Custom Monitoring

Add to your Railway environment:

```bash
# Optional: Sentry for error tracking
railway variables set SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn

# Optional: DataDog for APM
railway variables set DD_API_KEY=your_datadog_key
```

---

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Railway auto-deploys on git push to `main`:

```bash
# 1. Make changes to backend
git add .
git commit -m "Update backend API"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 3. Railway auto-detects and deploys
# Watch deployment: railway logs -f
```

**Disable auto-deploy:**
```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# Settings ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Trigger: Manual
```

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

| Service | Plan | Cost |
|---------|------|------|
| **Railway** | Trial | $5 credit (500 hours) |
| **Railway** | Hobby | $5/month |
| **Supabase** | Free | $0 (500MB DB) |
| **OpenAI** | Pay-as-you-go | ~$10-30/month |
| **Langfuse** | Free | $0 (optional) |

**Total for Test Phase:** $5-40/month

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Use Railway environment variables
2. **Rotate API keys** - Regularly update OpenAI and Supabase keys
3. **Use HTTPS only** - Railway provides this by default
4. **Enable rate limiting** - Already configured in middleware
5. **Monitor logs** - Watch for suspicious activity
