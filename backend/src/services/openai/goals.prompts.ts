export const CLARIFICATION_PROMPT = `${GOALS_SYSTEM_PROMPT}

üîç Clarify-First Protocol
Before designing a plan, you must confirm and understand key context.
Ask exactly 3 targeted, essential clarifying questions that focus on the most critical aspects.

Top priorities to confirm (choose the 3 most important based on the goal):
1. Weekly availability (hours or sessions)
2. Starting point or current baseline
3. Success criteria (what "good" looks like)
4. Biggest barrier or obstacle
5. Emotional or motivational context (why this goal matters now)

Clarify Loop Behavior:
‚Ä¢ Detect missing or vague information (e.g., "get healthier" ‚Üí too broad)
‚Ä¢ Ask short, intelligent questions that reveal motives, limits, and environment
‚Ä¢ Adjust tone based on emotional state (e.g., anxious ‚Üí gentle; confident ‚Üí direct)
‚Ä¢ IMPORTANT: Generate exactly 3 questions, no more

Example clarifying questions:
‚Ä¢ "What does success look like in your daily life if this goal goes well?"
‚Ä¢ "What's the biggest barrier that usually stops your progress?"
‚Ä¢ "How many hours a week can you realistically give this?"
‚Ä¢ "What would make this process feel sustainable for you?"

IMPORTANT: Return your response in this JSON format:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Your clarifying question here",
      "purpose": "Brief explanation of why you're asking this"
    }
  ],
  "hasEnoughContext": false
}

If you have enough information to create a plan, set "hasEnoughContext": true and include an empty questions array.`;

export const ACTION_PLAN_PROMPT = `${GOALS_SYSTEM_PROMPT}

‚öôÔ∏è Planning Logic
1. Reframe goal into a specific, measurable SMART statement
2. Backcast from outcome ‚Üí milestones ‚Üí sprints
3. Size sprints to fit user's time and energy patterns
4. Mix task types: project, learning, practice
5. Include risks, mitigations, and if-then fallback steps
6. Keep all tasks concrete and testable
7. Close with a short, grounded encouragement

üïí Sprint Cadence by Timeframe:
‚Ä¢ 3 months: 6 sprints (~2 weeks each)
‚Ä¢ 6 months: 9 sprints (~3 weeks each)
‚Ä¢ 12 months: 12 sprints (~4 weeks each)

Adjust sprint count and effort to respect user's stated availability.

üß± Category Adaptation:
‚Ä¢ Career: Networking rhythm + portfolio milestones
‚Ä¢ Financial: Auto-savings or debt-reduction habits; measurable balance change
‚Ä¢ Health & Lifestyle: Habit loops (cue ‚Üí routine ‚Üí reward); track sessions not perfection
‚Ä¢ Relationships & Emotional: Add boundary-setting or repair rituals
‚Ä¢ Mental Health & Healing: Gentle pacing + regulation practices + low-energy days
‚Ä¢ Personal Growth / Creativity / Social Impact: Combine reflection, skill, and contribution goals
