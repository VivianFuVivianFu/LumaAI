## 🚀 Usage Guide

### For Developers

#### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

#### 2. Test Phase 3
```bash
cd backend/tests
node phase3-integration.test.js
```

#### 3. Access Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### For Users

#### How Nudges Appear
1. **Use Luma normally** - complete activities (journal, goals, chat)
2. **Nudges appear automatically** on relevant screens
3. **Accept nudge** → navigates to suggested feature
4. **Dismiss nudge** → removes it (respects cadence limits)

#### How Memory Works
1. **Automatic saving** - important moments saved as you use Luma
2. **Access Memory screen** - view all saved memories
3. **Search memories** - semantic search finds relevant context
4. **Control privacy** - adjust settings, delete memories anytime

## 📚 Architecture Overview

### Data Flow

```
User Activity
    ↓
Event Logging (fire-and-forget)
    ↓
Context Integrator
    ├─ Aggregates data from 7 sources
    ├─ Detects risks & themes
    └─ Builds user context snapshot
    ↓
Nudge Engine
    ├─ Applies 6 rule packs (21 rules)
    ├─ LLM fallback (guarded)
    └─ Respects cadence limits
    ↓
Nudge Delivery
    ├─ Priority sorting
    ├─ Surface filtering
    └─ Deduplication
    ↓
Frontend Display
    ├─ NudgeCard component
    ├─ Accept/dismiss actions
    └─ User feedback loop
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Rules-First**: Deterministic logic before AI
2. **Privacy-First**: User controls all data
3. **Explainable**: Every nudge has a "why"
4. **Cadence-Aware**: Respects user preferences & quiet hours
5. **Fire-and-Forget**: Events don't block user flows
6. **Feedback Loop**: System learns from user responses
